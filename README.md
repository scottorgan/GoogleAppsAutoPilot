# Download and Deploy the latest versions of Google Chrome and Drive with AutoPilot

This script installs both Google Chrome & Drive during Autopilot by downloading the latest setup files from evergreen URLs.

The original version of this script was written by Jan Ketil Skanke @ MSEndpointMgr to download and install the latest release of the Microsoft 365 (Office) Apps.
It works so well that I decided to modify it (barely) to install the latest versions of Google Chrome and Drive.

A BIG thank you to Mr. Skanke and MSEndPointMgr for their awesome work.
